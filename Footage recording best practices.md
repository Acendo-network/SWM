So, for OBS, the ideal setting are at minimum 10,000 Kbps at either 1080p or 720p.
If you can record it in H.265 instead of H.264 it's all the better as the video quality will be increased.
Make sure the game audio is captured at full volume, and that there are no other sounds like microphones or desktop audio being recorded.
Also make sure to record enough filler footage before and after the interesting part happens, so that there's leeway during editing.
Something like 10 seconds before and after the moment is goat. Think about the fact that we're gonna do the transition animation from one clip to the next, and then the clip needs to play while we explain what's gonna happen / what the tip is, and then the thing must happen as we finish explaining it.
And then the clip must keep on playing while we add any bonus comments about this tip.
So that's why the extra filler footage is kinda essential.
That's all I think.
